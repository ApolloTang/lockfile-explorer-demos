## Preparing the Verdaccio environment

If you want to use `rush install` or `rush update` in the demo branches, the [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/)
NPM registry service needs to be running on localhost.

1. Clone the `main` branch of this repo
2. `pnpm install`
3. `pnpm start` to launch Verdaccio
4. In a separate shell window: `pnpm publish-all` to publish all of the [demo NPM packages](./demo-packages/) to localhost.
